Changing the Siteground CLI 
You can change the PHP CLI version through SSH. After connecting through SSH type cd ~ and then find .bash_profile file. Open the .bash_profile file with nano or vi which you would like to use and enter this line:

alias php=/usr/local/php72/bin/php-cli

and save the file. After that run command:

source .bash_profile

And your PHP CLI version has been changed. To confirm the PHP version type php -v and it will show you the version which you just changed.

P.S: In my case, I want to change the PHP CLI version to PHP 7.2 so I use php72 in alias php=/usr/local/php72/bin/php-cli. You can change it to any other version which you need.
